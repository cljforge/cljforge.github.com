            Hello, dear friend!

         <p>
            I'm glad to see you here. I would like to present you my repository site.
            You could see some interesting stuff over here soon.
         </p>

            But for now, please check out this awesome navigation element on your right.

            Sorry if I've crushed you hopes...

            I'm sure you've noticed repository name, and I could only imagine your disappointment, when you found nothing about
            <a href="clojure.org">Clojure</a>
            here...
         </p>
         <p>
            I promise that you could found "clojure staff" here soon!
